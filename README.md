# Hive Got Bugs (Front End) üêõ

Hive Got Bugs is a site where junior developers can share solutions to common coding problems, while also having access to expert, personalised help from an experienced mentor. This is the front end of the project, built using React, Firebase, Axios, Chart.js, and Styled Components. The site was built in two weeks as a final group project as part of the [Northcoders](https://www.northcoders.com/) coding bootcamp.
